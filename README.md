# DiaNet

Please note that this is not a medical website, we do not take your money or ask for any payment details, this website also requires approved access, meaning that you can only sign in if you have an account.

## DiaNet Will:

   - provide support to diabetics
   - provide digital services to diabetics and healthcare professionals
   - provide tips and tricks to diabetics
   - Provide information and education to non-diabetics

## Our Vision
DiaNet will give people the confidence, skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an ever-changing world.
We also want to show what diabetes is really like, in contrast to what people think


## News and guides
We want to be a source for news for diabetics and also to provide guides and comparisons for example; choosing a CGM or a pump.
Or for Approved Healthcare Providers to share news, information or resources with their patients

  
## Communities
We also hope to give people with Diabetes a place to chat, whether that's about diabetes or not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
We hope this is available over multiple platforms including Discord, our website and (maybe in the future) a mobile app
