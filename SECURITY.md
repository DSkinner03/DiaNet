## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, you should go to the support section and press security, you will then be asked to take a screen recording of the vulnerability and send it to us and describe the porblem, the steps we can take to recreate it and the link the vulnerability is on.

We will accept the vulnerability provided it is a global issue and update you via your dashboard. We ask that you do not share vulnerabilities to other users to help contain the issue.

Depending on the severity of the vulnerability we will patch it, take service, or take the site offline.
